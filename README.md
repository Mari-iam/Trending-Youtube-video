# Trending-Youtube-video
## Project Overview
YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. This data set includes several months of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, India and Japan. This list is determined by using user interactions such as views, comments and likes to identify which videos are user preferred and displays them on the trending page. Ranking of these videos is done based on a ratio of views, likes, comments and shares, in order to display the best videos at the top of the page. We used the data sets available and began the process of data cleaning followed by Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
## Used Datasets

## Objective
### 1-Data Cleaning
### 2-Explore and get insights
1.Ratio of likes-dislikes in different categories? <br />
2.Users like videos from which category more? <br />
3.Top 5 videos that are on trending in each country? <br />
4.Is the most liked video also the most trending video? <br />
5.Maximum number of days to trending status for a video?
## Used Technologies
* Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis, especially for handling structured data in the form of DataFrames.
* NumPy: A library used for numerical computations and handling large arrays and matrices of data.
* Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization to create plots, charts, and graphs during EDA.
* Datetime: Used for manipulating dates and times. This class is particularly useful for parsing, formatting, and comparing dates and times.
* Glob: Used for file pattern matching. It allows you to search for files and directories using wildcard patterns (e.g., *.csv to find all CSV files in a directory).
* JSON: For parsing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data or converting Python objects to JSON format.
* Pickle: For serializing and deserializing Python objects. You can use it to save Python objects to a file and load them later, which is useful for saving models, data structures, or other Python objects.
* Six: Important for maintaining compatibility in projects that need to run on both Python 2 and 3.
* Re: Provides functions and classes for working with regular expressions in Python.
